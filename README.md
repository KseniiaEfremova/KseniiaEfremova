I am a former qualified medical doctor turned Software Developer with a strong passion for coding. In 2022, I completed a 12-week intensive Bootcamp at Just IT, where I gained experience in front-end and back-end development and worked on projects using Python and JavaScript. Prior to the course, I self-taught Python, algorithms, data structures, and Git source control and created small projects for over a year.

After completing the Bootcamp, I continued to enhance my skills and learned React.js. Currently, I am studying at Xander Company, where I am improving my communication and technical skills while working in a team and creating exciting new projects.
